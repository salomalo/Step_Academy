Title: Fuit Machine
Description: A simple one armed bandit fruit machine game, that i creted to help me learn C++. This is my first program in C++ and i wrote it in about 2 days, purely to help learn the language.
Constructive critisms would be great to help me learn, but any one posting to tell me my games pointless, etc don't bother.
